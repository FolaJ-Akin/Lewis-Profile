        Hamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire,
        England.His father, Anthony Hamilton, is black and is of Grenadian
        descent, while his mother, Carmen Larbalestier, is White British, and
        from Birmingham,making him mixed-race;Hamilton has identified as black.
        Hamilton&apos;s parents separated when he was two, after which he lived
        with his mother and older half-sisters, Samantha and Nicola, until he
        was twelve. Hamilton then lived with his father, stepmother Linda, and
        his half-brother Nicolas, who is also a professional racing driver.
        Hamilton was raised a Catholic.
        <br />
        Hamilton&apos;s father bought him a radio-controlled car when he was
        five. Hamilton finished second in the national BRCA championship the
        following year against adult competition. Being the only black child
        racing at his club, Hamilton was subjected to racist abuse.
        Hamilton&apos;s father bought him a go-kart for Christmas when he was
        six and promised to support his racing career as long as he worked hard
        at school. To support his son, Hamilton&apos;s father took redundancy
        from his position as an IT manager and became a contractor, sometimes
        working up to four jobs at a time including employment as a double
        glazing salesman, dishwasher, and putting up signs for estate agents,
        while still attending his son&apos;s races. Hamilton&apos;s father later
        set up his own IT company. He continued to be Hamilton&apos;s manager
        until early 2010.
        <br />
        Hamilton was educated at The John Henry Newman School, a voluntary aided
        Catholic secondary school in Stevenage. At the age of five, Hamilton
        took up karate to defend himself as a result of bullying at school. He
        was also excluded from school for a period when he was mistakenly
        identified as having attacked a fellow student who was treated in
        hospital for his injuries. In addition to racing, he played association
        football for his school team with eventual England international, Ashley
        Young. Hamilton, an Arsenal fan, said that if Formula One had not worked
        for him, he would have been a footballer or a cricketer, having played
        both for his school teams. In February 2001, he began studies at
        Cambridge Arts and Sciences (CATS), a private sixth-form college in
        Cambridge.
