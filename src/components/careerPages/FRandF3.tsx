      <h1>Formula Renault and Formula Three</h1>
      <section>
        Hamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault
        Winter Series, finishing fifth in the standings. This led to a full 2002
        Formula Renault UK campaign with Manor Motorsport in which he finished
        third overall. He remained with Manor for another year, winning the
        championship ahead of Alex Lloyd. Having clinched the championship,
        Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his debut in
        the season finale of the British Formula 3 Championship. In his first
        race he was forced out with a puncture, and in the second he crashed out
        and was taken to hospital after a collision with teammate Tor Graves.

        Asked in 2002 about the prospect of becoming one of the youngest ever
        Formula One drivers, Hamilton replied that his goal was &quot;not to be
        the youngest in Formula One&quot; but rather &quot;to be experienced and
        then show what I can do in Formula One&quot;. He made his debut with
        Manor in the 2004 Formula 3 Euro Series, ending the year fifth in the
        championship. He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix and twice raced in
        the Macau F3 Grand Prix. Williams had come close to signing Hamilton but
        did not because BMW, their engine supplier at the time, would not fund
        him. Hamilton eventually re-signed with McLaren. According to then
        McLaren executive and future CEO Martin Whitmarsh, who was responsible
        for guiding Hamilton through the team&apos;s young driver programme, he
        and Anthony Hamilton had a &quot;huge row&quot; at the end of the
        season, with Lewis&apos; father pushing for him to move up to GP2 for
        2005, while Whitmarsh felt that he should remain in F3 for a second
        season, culminating in Whitmarsh tearing up Lewis&apos; contract;
        however, Lewis called Whitmarsh six weeks later and re-signed with the
        team.

        Hamilton first tested for McLaren in late 2004 at Silverstone. Hamilton
        moved to the reigning Euro Series champions ASM for the 2005 season and
        dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds. He also won the
        Marlboro Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort. After the season British
        magazine Autosport featured him in their &quot;Top 50 Drivers of
        2005&quot; issue, ranking Hamilton 24th.

      <h1>GP2</h1>
      <section>
        Hamilton moved to ASM&apos;s sister GP2 team, ART Grand Prix, for the
        2006 season. Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt,
        beating Nelson Piquet Jr. and Timo Glock. He secured a dominant win at
        the Nürburgring, despite a penalty for speeding in the pit lane. At his
        home race at Silverstone, Hamilton overtook two rivals at Becketts, a
        series of high-speed bends where overtaking is rare. In Istanbul he
        recovered from a spin that left him in eighteenth place to take second.
        Hamilton won the title in unusual circumstances, inheriting the final
        point he needed after Giorgio Pantano was stripped of fastest lap in the
        Monza feature race.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hamilton&apos;s success in the GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy
        at McLaren following the departure of Juan Pablo Montoya to NASCAR and
        Kimi Räikkönen to Ferrari. After months of speculation on whether
        Hamilton, Pedro de la Rosa or Gary Paffett would be paired with
        defending champion Fernando Alonso for 2007, Hamilton was confirmed as
        the team&apos;s second driver. He was told of McLaren&apos;s decision at
        the end of September, but the news was not made public for almost two
        months, for fear that it would be overshadowed by Michael
        Schumacher&apos;s retirement announcement.
