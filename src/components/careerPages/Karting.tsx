        Hamilton began karting in 1993 and quickly began winning races and cadet
        class championships. Two years later&apos; he became the youngest driver
        to win the British cadet karting championship at the age of ten. That
        year&apos; Hamilton approached McLaren Formula One team boss Ron Dennis
        at the Autosport Awards for an autograph and said: &quot;Hi. I&apos;m
        Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be
        racing your cars.&quot; Dennis wrote in Hamilton&apos;s autograph book:
        &quot;Phone me in nine years&apos; we&apos;ll sort something out
        then.&quot; When Hamilton was 12&apos; Ladbrokes took a bet&apos; at
        40/1 odds&apos; that Hamilton would win a Formula One race before the
        age of 23; another predicted&apos; at 150/1 odds&apos; that he would win
        the World Drivers&apos; Championship before he was 25. In 1998&apos;
        Dennis called Hamilton following his second Super One series and British
        championship wins&apos; to offer Hamilton a role in the McLaren driver
        development programme.The contract included an option of a future
        Formula One seat&apos; which would make Hamilton the youngest driver to
        secure a contract that later resulted in a Formula One drive.

        Hamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A (1999)&apos;
        Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks&apos; and became
        European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In Formula A and Formula
        Super A&apos; racing for TeamMBM.com&apos; his teammate was Nico
        Rosberg&apos; who would later drive for the Williams and Mercedes teams
        in Formula One; they would later team up again for Mercedes from 2013 to
        2016. Following his karting successes&apos; the British Racing
        Drivers&apos; Club made him a &quot;Rising Star&quot; Member in 2000. In
        2001&apos; Michael Schumacher made a one-off return to karts and
        competed against Hamilton along with other future Formula One drivers
        Vitantonio Liuzzi and Nico Rosberg. Hamilton ended the final in
        seventh&apos; four places behind Schumacher. Although the two saw little
        of each other on the track&apos; Schumacher praised the young Briton.
